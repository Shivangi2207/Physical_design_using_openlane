## OpenLANE

OpenLane is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, CVC, SPEF-Extractor, KLayout and a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization. It also provides a number of custom scripts for design exploration and optimization.
OpenLane abstracts the underlying open source utilities, and allows users to configure all their behavior with just a single configuration file.

## Magic
 

Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license, magic has remained popular with universities and small companies. The open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms which lend to magic the greatest part of its popularity. Magic is widely cited as being the easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who ultimately rely on commercial tools for their product design flow.

<details><summary>Soc Design and OpenLANE </summary>
An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) typically consists of three main parts:
 
  - RTL Designs : RTL IPs offer several advantages. They boost productivity, help bring products to market faster, and make designs more reliable. By using RTL IPs, designers can tap into well-                       tested and optimized components, reducing the chances of errors. Plus, they promote the reuse of designs, allowing engineers to mix and match different blocks to create more
                  complex systems. In essence, RTL IPs are like a shortcut to building sophisticated digital circuits.

  
  - EDA Tools : Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are software applications used in the design and development of electronic systems, integrated circuits (ICs), and printed circuit boards
                (PCBs). These tools are instrumental in various stages of the design process, from conceptualization and simulation to physical layout and verification. 
    
  - PDK Data : Process Development Kit(PDK) is a collection of files and documentation that describe a specific semiconductor fabrication process. PDKs are provided by semiconductor foundries to their
               customers, typically integrated circuit designers, to enable them to design and simulate chips using the foundry's manufacturing process.

# Simplified RTL to GSDII Flow

The flow involves of following steps:

- Synthesis : Synthesis is the process of transforming your HDL design into a gate-level netlist, given all the specified constraints and optimization settings. Logic synthesis is the process of
             translating and mapping RTL code written in HDL (such as Verilog or VHDL ) into technology specific gate level representation.

- Floorplanning : Floor Planning involves determining the location, shape, and size of modules in a way that one can avoid congestion. Floor Planning is a quintessential step which decides the
                  layout of the VLSI design. A well-optimized floor planning allows an ASIC design that has higher performance.

- Plcament : Placement is an essential step in physical design flow since it assigns exact locations for various circuit components within the chips core area.OpenLANE uses the detailed placement
             tool RePlAce for this purpose.

- Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) : Clock Tree Synthesis refers to the process of dispersing the clock and balancing the load. Basically, the clock is delivered to all successive parts. The technique
                               of inserting buffers or inverters along the clock pathways of an ASIC design to achieve zero/minimum skew or balanced skew is known as CTS.

- Routing : The process of creating physical connections based on logical connectivity. Signal pins are connected by routing metal interconnects. Routed metal paths must meet timing, clock skew, max
           trans/cap requirements and also physical DRC requirements.

- Sign-Off GDS2 : Perform a final sign-off on the GDSII file to confirm that it meets all design and manufacturing requirements. This step ensures that the layout is ready for photomask generation
                  and foundry submission.

- GDSII Generation: Generate the GDSII file, which contains the final geometric data for all layers of the chip. This file is used in the fabrication process.

# OpenLane ASIC flow :
The OpenLANE flow utilizes tools mainly from the Open-ROAD, YosysHQ, and Open Circuit Design projects.

![Screenshot from 2023-09-12 19-00-18](https://github.com/Shivangi2207/Physical_design_using_openlane/assets/140998647/96bb1517-adb2-4966-88a9-694f36b81188)


Fig. illustrates the basic default flow; this is what runs in the batch (non-interactive) mode. Most of the steps are configurable and custom flows can be created by the use of interactive scripts. The flow expects the design source HD files as an input as well as the desired PDK source files

- RTL Synthesis and STA : The design is synthesized into a gate-level netlist using yosys and static timing analysis is performed on the resulting netlist using OpenSTA

- Insertion of DFT structures : An open-source Design For Testability (DFT) toolchain, Fault [9], can optionally be used to modify the netlist, inserting scan chains and the necessary IO ports to
                                scan and test thedesign after fabrication.

- Physical Implementation : Advancing with the physical implementation, we note that most of the tools in this stage are used from within the Open- ROAD application in combination with other
                            tools, some of them are custom and based on the OpenDB infrastructure, while others are indpendent., OpenLANE supports two more use cases besides the default one in the                              OpenROAD application; one of them is fully custom I/O pin placement for ases where a user would prefer to have strict control over pin locations. The other custom mode,
                            which is particularly useful during SoC integration to achieve clean routing on the top- level is the so-called contextualized I/O placement; this mode automatically
                            places the I/O pins optimally according to the context of their instantiation at a higher level of hierarchy

- Post-routing Evaluation of Result : DRC and LVS are then performed using magic  and netgen . Antenna checking is performed by either OpenROADâ€™s ARC (Antenna Rule Checker) or using magic.
                                      Extraction of parasitics from the routed layout is then done using SPEF EXTRACTOR , followed by another round of static timing analysis to have more
                                      accurate timing reports that correspond to the actual physical layout

## Day 2

<details><summary>Good flooplan vs Bad Floorplan and introduction to library cells </summary>
<details><summary>Chip floorplanning consideration </summary>
The two most important parameters are:

- Utilisation : Core utilization factor is defined as the ratio of the area of the design (area of the standard cells + area of the macro cells) to the core area.It is better to have a utilization
                Factor of 0.5 to 0.6 to accomodate any extra logic later on.
- Aspect Ratio : Aspect ratio will decide the size and shape of the chip. It is the ratio between horizontal routing resources to vertical routing resources (or) ratio of height and width. Aspect
                 ratio = width/height.Aspect ratio of 1 signifies that the die is of square shape and any other value other than 1 signifies that the die is rectangular shape.

# Floor planning

Pre-placed Cells : Pre-placed cells (or pre-placed blocks) in ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design refer to predefined and fixed blocks of logic or circuitry that are manually 
                   placed in specific locations on the semiconductor chip's layout before the automated placement and routing process.These cells are placed manually by the chip designer or through                    automated tools. Since these IP's are placed before automated Placement and Routing, these are reffered to as Pre-placed cells.

Decoupling capacitors: Pre-placed cells must then be surrounded with decoupling capacitors (decaps). The resistances and capacitances associated with long wire lengths can cause the power supply  
                       voltage to drop significantly before reaching the logic circuits.Their role is to decouple the circuit from power supply by supplying the necessary amount of current to the                          circuit. They pervent crosstalk and enable local communication.

Power Planning:Let us suppose that there are multiple macros in a chip and output changes from '1' to '0', then it discharged into ground line because of which we can see ground bumpp. Similarly  
              when it is charged from 0 to 1 we can see voltage drop in power supply.Hence to resolve this we can have multiple supply line for vdd as well as ground as shown below:

Pin Placement : The netlist defines connectivity between logic gates. The place between the core and die is utilised for placing pins. The connectivity information coded in either VHDL or Verilog                  is used to determine the position of I/O pads of various pins. The input, output and Clock pins are placed optimally such that there is less complication in routing or optimised                     delay.
![Screenshot from 2023-09-10 22-39-26](https://github.com/Shivangi2207/Physical_design_using_openlane/assets/140998647/6defb5df-c7ce-4112-be5f-c90029002da8)

The Clock port are bigger than the normal I/O pins because of it's continuous use and larger area offers less resistance.
Final design:
